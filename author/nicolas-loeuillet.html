          14/09/2015: We are very proud to announce the release of wallabag 2.0.0-alpha <a href="/blog/2015/09/14/wallabag-v2-alpha-finally" class="alert-link">Please read our blog post</a>.
        </div>

            <article>
                <h2><a href="https://www.wallabag.org/blog/2015/09/14/wallabag-v2-alpha-finally">wallabag 2.0.0-alpha, finally</a></h2>
                <div class="summary"><p><strong>wallabag is a read-it-later application</strong>. Its main advantage it's open source. You know what we do with your data: nothing!</p>
<p>We created it in 2013, with some PHP classes.
Quickly, we saw that wallabag was technically limited (no API, database fields missing, etc.).</p>
<p>We decided to rewrite it from scratch, using a framework. We started this v2 many times. But we missed time.</p>
<p>In 2014, Jérémy Benoist (<a href="https://github.com/j0k3r">aka @j0k3r</a>) joined us. He is a Symfony lead developer, so it was a great news for us.<br />
He does a very good job.</p>
<p>We think it's time to release a first version of wallabag v2. All the features from the v1 are still not developed, but we need to test it in order to continue the development.</p>
<p>I'm very happy with this new big step in wallabag's life: the first release of wallabag v2.</p>
<h2>Features already implemented</h2>
<p>Here are the main features already implemented:</p>
<ul>
<li>a REST API (<a href="http://v2.wallabag.org/api/doc">you can have a look to the documentation</a>)</li>
<li>authorization via oAuth2</li>
<li>a new default theme, called <code>material</code></li>
<li>save an article, read it, favorite it, archive it. Hopefully.</li>
<li>assign tags to entries</li>
<li>you can edit the articles title</li>
<li>RSS feeds (with a limit parameter)</li>
<li>create a new account from config page</li>
<li>you can filter entries by reading time, domain name, creation date, status, etc.</li>
<li>recover your password from login page (you have to fill your email on config page)</li>
<li>picture preview, if available, is displayed for each entry</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
<p>There are less features in this alpha version than in the 1.9. But we still have lot of work to do.</p>
<h2>Test wallabag 2.0.0-alpha</h2>
<p>We published this alpha on our v2 demo website: <a href="http://v2.wallabag.org">http://v2.wallabag.org</a> (login wallabag, password wallabag)</p>
<p>Try it, and try it again. And again. There are bugs, so tell us if you found one of them (have a look <a href="https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag/issues">at the existing issues</a> and <a href="https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag/issues/new">create a new one</a> if necessary).</p>
<h2>Install wallabag 2.0.0-alpha</h2>
<p>Keep in mind it's an <strong>instable</strong> branch, everything can be broken. Please don't use in production.</p>
<p>wallabag v2 uses <a href="http://symfony.com">Symfony2 framework</a>, one of the main reference in PHP development.</p>
<p>The only way to install wallabag v2 properly at the moment is to use composer. To download wallabag, <a href="{filename}download.md">you can click here</a> or clone the project via git:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>git clone https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag.git -b v2
cd wallabag
composer install
php app/console wallabag:install
php app/console server:run
</pre></div>


<h2>The road is still long</h2>
<p>We have still lot of work to have a great v2, but this first alpha is a big step in our roadmap. We won't communicate any date for the final version, so don't ask us ;-)</p>
<p>You're still there? Go test wallabag v2!</p>

                <div class="summary"><p>2015 will be a great year for wallabag, because we worked very hard and we'll release a first alpha of wallabag v2.</p>
<p>To welcome this new version, we wanted a new house.</p>
<p><strong>Welcome in our new house!</strong></p>
<p>Feel free to visit this house, but take care, paint is perhaps still fresh.<br />
We officially publish <a href="https://www.wallabag.org/pages/roadmap.html">our roadmap for wallabag v2</a>, you can have a look on this page to see our TODO list before the first release.</p>
<p>If you want to help us, there are two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>you can choose for a project on <a href="https://www.wallabag.org/pages/development.html">our Development page</a> and contribute to it, depending on your skills.</li>
<li>you can also <a href="https://www.wallabag.org/pages/donations.html">make a donation</a>. And because we want transparency, we'll <a href="https://www.wallabag.org/pages/donations-archives.html">publish monthly your donations</a>.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Now, we can put all our efforts on the latest features to implement for wallabag v2. Stay tuned!</p>

                <h2><a href="https://www.wallabag.org/blog/2015/08/10/a word about our browser extensions">A word about our browser extensions</a></h2>
                <div class="summary"><p>It's been a week since <a href="https://www.wallabag.org/blog/2015/08/03/wallabag-v1.9.1-released">we've released v1.9.1</a> and it seems there's no major bug coming out. That's great, because it leave us time to work on v2. We'll show you how much we've progressed later, I just wanted to say a word about our browser extensions.</p>
<h2>Chrome Extension</h2>
<p>The chrome extension has been updated with the right click-menu function named <em>Add page to wallabag</em>, as you can see on the picture below.
<img alt="Chrome Extension" src="/images/chrome_ext.png" /></p>
<p>This update has been pushed three days ago on the Chrome Web Store, so you should have got it by now.</p>
<h2>Opera Extension</h2>
<p>Although Opera is having a <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/article/2968277/web-browsers/opera-browser-maker-up-for-sale.html">hard time right now</a>, we don't forget users who use this browser. So we added <a href="http://doc.wallabag.org/en/User/save_your_first_article.html#opera">a documentation chapter</a> in order for users to install it, while the extension is currently submitted and is awaiting validation. It's far from perfect (the right-click menu item opens a new window), but hey it's here.
We'll update this post to share with you the URL of the Opera Extension Repository when we'll get it.</p>
<h2>Firefox Social API</h2>
<p>Some of you may have missed it, but since Firefox 38.0.5, Pocket is integrated by default in Mozilla's browser. We were quite sad about this integration which surprised us. So <a href="http://www.cdetc.fr/reponse-mozilla">we wrote to Mozilla and they said</a> they were working on something so that other read-it-later services can be included. We'll see about that. And we're eager to work with you, red panda !</p>
<p>Apart from this, we've launched with wallabag 1.9.1 the wallabag Firefox Service (go into Config to discover it - https needed). It's quite basic, but it will be much more elaborated with wallabag v2 and it's API, just like all extensions and mobile apps.</p>
<h2>wallabag v2</h2>
<p>Now for the big stuff. It comes. There have been quite some work, but the most important thing right now is the arrival of a new theme in material style logically called <em>material</em>. This theme should be the main one on v2. We all can thank Alexandr Danilov for his work.</p>
<p>Here's a preview below :
<img alt="list of articles" src="/images/material1.png" /></p>
<p><img alt="article view" src="/images/material2.png" /></p>
<p>The best news is that you can test it yourself at <a href="v2.wallabag.org">v2.wallabag.org</a>. Just keep in mind that it's in alpha state, and many features are missing. But it's just a matter of time.</p>
<p>We'll keep you updated when a real alpha is available for you to test in the upcoming weeks, and remember you can help our project. I remind you <a href="https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag/issues/1254">our main issue</a> explaining on how you can help. </p>
<p>See you soon,</p>
<p>Thomas</p>

                <div class="summary"><p>We are happy to announce you the release of wallabag v1.9.1. Unlike what it seems, it's quite an important version (it's just between 1.9 and 2.0). A whole number of bugs have been corrected, some translations added, many config websites files added, and there's also a handful of new features we hope you'll like.</p>

<li>Gestures on touch screens. Swipe to left or right to navigate to next or previous articles.</li>
<li>Toolbar also at the bottom of the article with baggy theme, you don't have to scroll back any more when finished !</li>
<li>While you tag an article, you now see all the existing tags. Just click on them to add it to this article. And the more used are shown bigger.</li>

</ul>
<h2>Session issues</h2>
<p>It's no secret that we've had kind of a hard deal to fix sessions issues. You always ended up disconnected after a while. The thing is, just a little configuration should get rid of this issues. <a href="http://doc.wallabag.org/en/Administrator/sessions.html">Checkout the documentation there</a>.</p>
<p>This bug is already fixed on Framabag.org. </p>
<h2>Application for Firefox OS</h2>

<h2>wallabag v2</h2>
<p>This is the end of wallabag <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0GFRcFm-aY">as we know it</a>. ~~We launch our premium version~~ We get rid of the old code. We've rebuild wallabag using Symfony2 and it's now much better to work efficiently with clean code.</p>
<p>We will release a first alpha release of wallabag 2.0 in september 2015. You can follow latest news on <a href="https://twitter.com/wallabagapp">twitter</a>, <a href="https://gitter.im/wallabag/wallabag#initial">gitter</a> or <a href="https://framasphere.org/u/wallabag">diaspora*</a>.</p>

<h2>Need help!</h2>
<p>Our project is bigger and bigger, and we always need some help. We <a href="https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag/issues/1254">opened a new ticket on github</a> where we are listing all our needs. Pick one of them and welcome on board!</p>
                    <a class="btn btn-default btn-xs" href="https://www.wallabag.org/blog/2015/08/03/wallabag-v1.9.1-released">more ...</a>

                <h2><a href="https://www.wallabag.org/blog/2015/04/05/april-update">April update : some news</a></h2>
                <div class="summary"><p>No <a href="https://www.wallabag.org/blog/2014/04/01/wallabag-integrates-facebook">april's fool</a> this year, but just some news to keep you updated on our work. </p>
<h2>Work towards 1.9.1 version</h2>
<p>First of all, there's quite a few bugs which have been corrected, especially with installation part (still...). Also, a couple of annoying graphic bugs are now gone. An updated Docker image is also on track.</p>
<p>Now, talking about some features, I know we said we wouldn't add any more to 1.x versions, that everything will go to v2, but that kind of work will benefit to all versions anyway. And those are little ones, don't get excited. ;)</p>
<p>I'm happy to announce next versions will feature <em>previous and next navigation buttons</em> just next to the already existing "return to top" one with baggy theme. Default theme and inherited themes will have those buttons in the existing toolbar. </p>
<p><img alt="buttons" src="/images/wallabag_navigate_arrows.png" /></p>
<p>You will also be able to navigate through articles by using your <em>right and left keyboard</em> arrows on desktop, or <em>swipe right or left</em> on touchscreen devices. Maybe we could enable vim-style navigation (with <code>hjkl</code>) in the future (there's <a href="https://framadate.org/u6k7qlcmwvdr8df6">a poll</a>, by the way).</p>
<p>For an increased usability, we also added a <em>Mark as read and go to next button</em>, when you've finished to read an article and do want to go for the next time directly.</p>
<p>Also, about the toolbar, we added it at the bottom of articles seen with baggy theme, so that you don't have to go all the way to top when wanting to do an action.</p>
<p>Finally, we now display existing tags when you want to add a tag to an article, in order to avoid having close duplicates and not thinking to tags you already have. You will just have to click on a tag to add it to the list. And, the larger the size of the tag displays, the more it's used, like a tag cloud.</p>
<p>Before wallabag 1.9.1 comes out, we just want to fix a nasty issue with installation with old MySQL versions and it should be ready to go. It could be possible to see a 1.9.2 version come out, though.</p>
<h2>Work on v2 version</h2>
<p>If you follow <a href="https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag/">our Github page</a>, you may have seen a lot of Pull Request ready to merge or already merged. That's a very good sign. Of the new things that are coming, the API is certainly the most important. Documentation is already <a href="http://v2.wallabag.org/api/doc/">available</a> and we will provide a guide very soon to connect your app to wallabag.
Speaking of apps, the Windows version is the first app <a href="https://github.com/wallabag/windows-app/commits/v2">currently rewritten</a> for v2 by @jlnostr. Others should follow soon, no worries.
Most of the job on wallabag v2 is currently done by @j0k3r, so now you know who to thank.</p>
<h2>Other news</h2>
<p>We may attend to the 16th <a href="https://2015.rmll.info/?lang=en">Libre Software Meeting</a> from 2015/07/04 to 2015/07/10 in Beauvais, France. Comme and see us, we'll have <a href="https://twitter.com/TcitWorld/status/544127704489275392/photo/1">stickers</a> !</p>
<p>Also, Pyves created <a href="https://framabag.org/cquoi/#/">cool slides</a> to present our wallabag hosted service, <a href="https://framabag.org/">Framabag</a>.</p>
<p>And finally, we already had wallabag integrated inside <a href="https://yunohost.org">YunoHost</a> (<a href="https://github.com/abeudin/wallabag_ynh">source</a>) and <a href="http://arkos.io/">ArkOS</a> (<a href="https://github.com/cznweb/arkos-applications/tree/master/wallabag">source</a>), but we're now hoping to get wallabag inside <a href="http://cozy.io">CozyCloud</a>. We'll also try to have it <a href="https://owncloud.org/">OwnCloud</a> too.</p>

<h2>Mobi &amp; PDF export</h2>
<p>First of all, we know some of you love reading articles saved with wallabag on your tablet or e-ink reader, so we've given you the ability to export your articles as epub a while back. But since there are users who have choosen a Kindle or some other tablets which can only handle mobi export, we give you mobi export.</p>
<p>Yes, we know that Amazon provides this kind of service called Send2Kindle, but it's kind of hard to  implement, even though we are still thinking to work on it. <a href="https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag/issues/770">Read more</a>.</p>
<p>Oh, and while we've at exporting articles, you can also export articles as pdf. Just like you already did with mobi and epub export. You can enable both of those features in the <code>inc/poche/config.inc.php</code> file. Look at the <code>inc/poche/config.inc.default.php</code> file to see what configuration you need to add if you're migrating.</p>
<h2>Sharing with services</h2>
<p>We want wallabag to be compatible with the maximum of services. For that, we have waited long for v2 to come with it's API (more on that later) but for now we just let you export your articles to <a href="https://evernote.com/intl/fr/">Evernote</a>, <a href="https://carrot.org">Carrot</a> and <a href="https://joindiaspora.com">Diaspora</a>. Just enable these features like the others, into the config file. In the case of Diaspora, you also need to provide the URL for your pod.</p>
<h2>New installer</h2>
<p>Finally, we've seen many users having problems (mostly database and file rights related) with the installation, so we rewrote much of the installer to make sure these problems won't occur anymore.</p>
<p>Moreover, the installer tells you right away if your webserver configuration has problems or can run wallabag right away.</p>
<h2>Diverse features, improvements and bugs</h2>
<p>Now for some little features :</p>
<ul>
<li>Random article : Don't know what to read ? Just click on the dices to get one of your unread articles.</li>
<li>Refetch article : Some article has changed it's content ? Just refetch it.</li>
<li>Import tags : You can now import tags from your Pocket and wallabag exported files.</li>
<li>Build-in documentation : If you have wallabag locally installed and are offline for the moment. Just a reminder to tell you that online documentation is available at <a href="http://doc.wallabag.org">http://doc.wallabag.org/</a></li>
<li>Tag an article when saving it. Instead of saving an article, accessing it and setting the tags from here, just click on the tag icon next to the url field before hitting the Save button. At the moment, it is possible only to do this from the web interface, but it could come to some apps or extensions.</li>
</ul>
<p>And in other changes, we've deleted the courgette theme, which started to be a bit old in regard of the features we brought recently. It's creator said he would be glad to bring a new theme in the future, though.</p>
<p>We've got also a lot of improvements, translations updated and diverse bugs corrected, but I admit there are really too many for me to list them here.</p>
<h2>Register</h2>
<p>Oh, wait. I've forgotten something. And it's quite important. There's now new lines in the config file which allow the adminstrator of a wallabag server to enable public registration. </p>
<p>You read that right. </p>
<p>If you want to share your instance with someone else, no need to create him an account yourself.</p>
<p>All the user needs is an username and a password. And if he provides it's email, he will get a nice confirmation email (which will probably go right into his spam inbox, but that's another issue).</p>
<h2>Upgrading from an older version</h2>
<p>If you already have an other version of wallabag installed, just copy the new files over the old ones, maybe check your rights on the files, and access your wallabag instance. In case something doesn't work, all you need to do is to delete the <code>install/</code> folder.</p>
<h2>Future of wallabag</h2>
<p>wallabag 1.9 should be the last version with new features. We will surely have at least a 1.9.1 version for bug fixes, but most of our work is now focused on wallabag v2, where @nicosomb and @j0k3r have started an amazing job. In fact, there's already a (working !) preview available at http://v2.wallabag.org/ (login/password : wallabag/wallabag). What do you think about the theme ?</p>
<p>v2 is build with Symfony2, a robust and powerful PHP framework. It allows us to design wallabag much better, to have a full view of what it must be, much better that the 1.x versions which are quite an ugly patchwork of code. Now, we're nearly starting over from scratch, but it's quite pleasant.</p>
<p>The v2 version will finally allow us to provide the API we've so much dreamed of, so that any app can be connected to wallabag and benefit of all it's features, whether it's a mobile app, a browser extension or another web service.</p>
<p>We look forward to release some previews for v2 when it's ready, and hear from you.</p>
<p>The wallabag contributors</p>
<p>PS: I want to send a huge thank you to @tcitworld for this great version!</p>
